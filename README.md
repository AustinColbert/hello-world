Hi!
     My name is Austin. In 2016 I made the decision to create a new career path for myself and learn to code. I'm 34, so I feel very late in the game, but it's never a bad time to learn something new, right? Hopefully, you CAN teach an old dog new tricks! I'm excited to be starting this new adventure, and am committed to bettering my skills for myself and my family. Cheers!
